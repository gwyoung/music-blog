        Named after the fun phrase that a family member once used to describe my music tastes, <strong>Bricks Clapping In The Dark</strong> is a blog for recommending and writing about music with a focus on overlooked and underrated albums both new and new to me.

        This site was created in response to the prevailing negativity in the hype-and-destroy cycle of the music criticism industry these days and as such everything presented here is a glowing recommendation. However, it goes without saying that not all albums are created equal, so if your listening time is limited you should head straight for those must-haves marked with this stamp of approval:
